# Multiplayer Phaser and SocketIO Game Template

This is a template for creating multiplayer online mini-games (similar to io-type games) using PhaserJS for the game and Socket.io for communication between client and server

## Commands

- `npm i` to install dependencies.
- `npm dev` to run the project in development mode.
- `npm build` to build the project.
- `npm start` to run the built project.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
````

2. Run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

To deploy the project, follow these steps:

1. Generate the bundle using:
```bash
npm build
```

2. Execute the built bundle with:
```
npm start
```

Alternatively, the template includes a Dockerfile that you can use directly to create a container.


## Note
It's recommended to use pnpm instead of npm for managing dependencies. You can install pnpm globally via npm:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then you can use pnpm in place of npm for the commands mentioned above.



Feel free to adjust or expand upon this template as needed for your project!
